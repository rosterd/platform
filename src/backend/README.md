## Build & Run
If you are using Visual Studio Code, make sure you your launch.json has correct configuration.
Ideally, you can just select the `backend` folder so VSCode will point to correct files. 
Once you run the application, api will be available locally at `https://localhost:5001`.

### Swagger
Once you have api running locally, you can hit the swagger endpoint at:
`https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html`
